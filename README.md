#Password Website

This is the password website that I added JavaScript to to run correctly. It allows the user to create a password between the lengths of 8 and 128 characters. It then asks the user what kind of characters they would like to use, and they can choose between uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. If the user doesn't select any, it then prompts them to choose at least one. Once all conditions are met, it then will display the password in the center of the screen. Please enjoy and let me know if you have anything that I can change or edit about the code!
